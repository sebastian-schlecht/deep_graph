# Deep Graph
Super light-weight deep learning API based on Theano.
Theano is available at https://github.com/Theano/Theano.

## About
Deep Graph is a very lightweight API on top of Theano inspired by similar frameworks like Keras, Lasagne or Blocks.

This library is a work in progress and not tested so far.


## Installation
There is no setup script yet, I will provide one soon.

## Requirements
For (un-)pickling we need version 0.8 of Theano. It is also listed in requirements.txt

For GPU compilation, CUDA must be installed and the CUDA compiler (nvcc) has to be a part of PATH.
See http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html for more details.
